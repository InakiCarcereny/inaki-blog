    description: `Zustand or Redux? ü§î
If you're in the world of frontend development, you've probably heard about Redux, but... have you tried Zustand? üêª Here's a comparison that can help you decide which one to use in your next project. üöÄ

1. Setup
-Redux: Requires more complex initial setup. You need to create reducers, actions, and a store. With tools like Redux Toolkit, this process is simplified, but still requires some effort.

-Zustand: Super simple! You only need one file for your store, and there are no mandatory actions or reducers. It's more straightforward and less ceremonial.

2. Size
-Redux: About 12 KB compressed.

-Zustand: About 2 KB compressed, perfect for projects where weight matters.

3. API
-Redux: Follows an approach based on solid principles like immutability and strict (one-way) data flow. However, its API can be intimidating for beginners.

-Zustand: Offers a minimalist API that is easy to understand. You can work directly with state mutations without worrying about strict immutability (although you can force it if you want).

4. Scalability
-Redux: Designed for large, complex applications. Scaling is easier thanks to its mature ecosystem and tooling.

-Zustand: Ideal for small to medium-sized applications. Although it supports larger projects, its flexibility can lead to less consistency on large teams.

5. DevTools
-Redux: Includes a robust ecosystem with Redux DevTools, which is perfect for debugging.

-Zustand: Also supports Redux DevTools, but it is not as complete as Redux's native support.

6. Selector and Re-rendering
-Redux: You can optimize with reselect or memoization, but it requires additional configuration.

-Zustand: Use selectors natively and efficiently to avoid unnecessary re-rendering.

Conclusion
Use Redux if... you are building a complex application, have a large team, or need a standardized solution.

Use Zustand if... you are looking for speed, simplicity or are working on a small to medium-sized application.`,
